## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Includes visualization for popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Cyclic Sort.
- **Interactive UI:** Visualizes each step of the sorting process, allowing users to see how data is sorted in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics:** Displays time complexity and space complexity for each algorithm.
- **Customization:** Adjustable animation speed to observe sorting algorithms at different paces.
